# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Analysis

### Purpose

- The main purpose of the PyBer analysis is to utilize Pandas and Matplotlit to help visualize the ride-sharing summary based on different type of cities. In this project, multiple-line graph will be utilized to show the total weekly fares of ride data by city types in order to help PyBer make a smart business decision.

## Results

- There are three types of citys: Rural, Suburban and Urban. As seen in below data table, total rides and and drivers increased drivers served in bigger geography (in rural, suburban, urban order). As one can assume number of rides would drive the total fares, urban city has the high number of fares earned. On contrary, average fare per ride and average fare per driver both experienced reductino as we moved towards bigger city type with more number of drivers.

- As observed in below "PyBer Fare Summary", all three types of cities experienced gradual increase in total fare earned from January to the week prior to March, then again in the beginning of April.

## Summary
To summarize, there are number of recommendations to provide to the CEO of V.Isualize.First the ratio of total rides over total drivers for rural area is much higher than suburban and urban cities. This means that drivers in the smaller cities are providing more rides than suburban and urban areas. Drivers in the urban and suburban areas can transfer to rural and suburban areas to alleviate the high demand, thus balancing the average rides drivers are actually providing per day.

Second recommendation is that, since customers in rural areas have a likelyhood of travelling longer distances, it would be advisable to provide a fare plan that promotes discount to target these customers that require longer distances per ride. High fare cost would discourage the rural population to use the ride-sharing service, thus risking the health of the business by reduced customer satisfaction.

Lastly, we recommend that is that the profitability of urban areas are much lower than rural (about 30% lower). We recommend slowly increasing the fare cost in the urban areas to monitor the number of total rides, in order to maximize the profitability of the ride share in the urban areas.
